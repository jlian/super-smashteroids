Known Issues
------------------

- Currently, if the program is compiled outside of Eclipse (our chosen IDE), anything resources (fonts, images, music) cannot be used by the game due to directory issues. We are working on it. 

- Once all the lives run out, the game crashes. We are working on a fix.

- Background currently doesnâ€™t work on UNIX systems.

Dependencies
------------------

Super Smasteroids needs the latest version of Java installed to compile and run successfully.
