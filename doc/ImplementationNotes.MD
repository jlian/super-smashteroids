Implementation Notes
====================

Behavior that we did not have time to implement
------------------------------------------------

- Pause Menu was not implemented because it was low on our priority list, and kind of forgot.
- Bombs were not implemented because they were deemed to be difficult
- Save/load feature was not implemented because we didn't have enough experience and confidence to try.
- NEW HIGH SCORE jingle was not implemented because we ran out of time
- We don't have fancy graphics for bonus drops because it was low in priority
- Alternating multiplayer was not implemented because we implemented simultaneous multiplayer instead, which is better


Potential improvements (If we had more time)
--------------------------------------------

- We could have more structured code that aligned with the SAD a bit more
- We could have more refined test files. We did not start testing early enough (part of the reason why is we really had no idea where to start)
- Better graphics. Maybe self-produced sprites.
- Better gameplay features such as more fun, random drops, and more
- We spent a lot of time wrestling with git
- Non-hackable high scores
- Fix cross-platform compatibility for sounds
- Align with the SRS better
